    Examples
    --------
    The easiest way to create a first-party (SQL or Snowpark) connection is to use their
    default names and define corresponding sections in your config.toml file.

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>> conn = st.connection("sql")  # Config section defined in [connections.sql] in secrets.toml.

    Creating a SQL connection with a custom name requires you to explicitly specify the
    type. If type is not passed in as a kwarg, we try to infer it from the contents of
    your secrets.toml.

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>> conn1 = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type="sql")  # Config section defined in [connections.my_sql_connection].
    >>> conn2 = st.connection("my_other_sql_connection")  # Type is inferred from [connections.my_other_sql_connection].

    Passing the full module path to the connection class that you want to use can be
    useful, especially when working with a custom connection:

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>> conn = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type="streamlit.connections.SQL")

    Finally, you can even pass the connection class to use directly to this function.

    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>> from streamlit.connections import SQL
    >>> conn = st.connection("my_sql_connection", type=SQL)
